README

This sample program displays a live image from the camera on the screen. Because
this project is in an early stage, white balancing and auto gain is not
implemented and the image is not perfect. The program runs for one minute and
halts then, after showing the frame rate in the log output, which is available
via the serial interface (GPIO14 at 115200 Bps) only.

You have to set your CAMERA_MODULE version (1 or 2) in the file ../config.h
before build. You may also adjust some image parameters (e.g. width and height,
vertical and horizontal flip) there. Especially the gain values are important
for a good quality image under different light conditions on the Camera Module
2. Camera Module 1 can adjust this automatically and these values do not count
here. For width and height only the given combinations are supported.

On the Raspberry Pi 2 and newer models, it is recommended to create a file
cmdline.txt on the SD card with this contents:

	fast=true

This enables the full speed of the Raspberry Pi, which is important because the
image conversion from Bayer (camera) to RGB (display) format is done by the CPU
and is time consuming. Currently a maximum frame rate of about 12 Hz is possible
on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ for an 1280x1024 image.
