README

This sample program allows to capture an image with the camera and save it to
the SD card in a raw RGB888 format. You have to attach an USB PC keyboard to use
it. The program displays a preview image, so that you can adjust the camera
controls exposure, analog gain and digital gain with the keyboard, before
capturing the image. You may adjust the parameters image width and height,
vertical and horizontal flip in the file ../config.h before build.

Via the keyboard you can choose the following functions:

KEY	FUNCTION				OTHER KEYS

c	Capture image				Space, Enter
e	Select exposure to be adjusted
a	Select analog gain to be adjusted
d	Select digital gain to be adjusted
	(Camera Module 2 only)
+	Increase selected control by 10%	Up
-	Decrease selected control by 10%	Down
w	Toggle white balancing on/off
	(not necessary on Camera Module 1)
q	Reboot					x

You may have to create a file cmdline.txt on the SD card with this contents to
set your keyboard layout:

	keymap=CC

The supported country codes (CC) are: DE, ES, FR, IT, UK and US.

The created .data image files can be opened for example in the GNU Image
Manipulation Program (GIMP). You have to specify the Width and Height of the
image, as given in the file name and the Image type RGB in the open dialog
window.

Alternatively you can convert the .data files to .png files with the provided
data2png tool. It requires LibGD (https://libgd.github.io/) installed for build.
You may have to adjust the image WIDTH and HEIGHT (default 640x480) in the file
data2png.c before build. Then just enter:

	make data2png
	./data2png image-640x480-rgb888-01.data image-01.png
