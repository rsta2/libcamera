README

This sample program allows to capture an image with the camera and save it to
the SD card in a raw RGB565 format. You have to attach an USB PC keyboard to use
it. The program displays a preview image, so that you can adjust the camera
controls exposure, analog gain and digital gain with the keyboard, before
capturing the image. You may adjust the parameters image width and height,
vertical and horizontal flip in the file kernel.cpp before build.

Via the keyboard you can choose the following functions:

KEY	FUNCTION				OTHER KEYS

c	Capture image				Space, Enter
e	Select exposure to be adjusted
a	Select analog gain to be adjusted
d	Select digital gain to be adjusted
+	Increase selected control by 10%	Up
-	Decrease selected control by 10%	Down
q	Reboot					x

You may have to create a file cmdline.txt on the SD card with this contents to
set your keyboard layout:

	keymap=CC

The supported country codes (CC) are: DE, ES, FR, IT, UK and US.

The created .data image files can be opened for example in the GNU Image
Manipulation Program (GIMP). You have to specify the Width and Height of the
image, as given in the file name and the Image type RGB565 (little endian) in
the open dialog window. It is recommended to apply the white balance function
(Colors > Auto > White Balance) to the image to correct the color values.
Currently the sample program does not do this on its own.
